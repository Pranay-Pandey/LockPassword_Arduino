# LockPassword Arduino

This project gives the arduino implementation for a lock that requires a 6 digit pincode to unlock.
The connnections and the code are given seperately.

● A combinational lock using pushbuttons and an LCD interface. <br>
● There are 6 push buttons each with an LED. When the button is pressed, the LED blinks. <br>
● The reset button. This button will reset the present password and will generate a new password randomly. <br>
● Initially, the message is printed on LCD to enter the password. <br>
● If the entered password is correct, then “correct password” is printed on the LCD screen. <br>
● If the entered password is incorrect, then “incorrect password…Try again” is printed on the LCD screen.<br><br>
